    <p>
        My name is Maxim Bardin, I was born in Russia and moved to Israel when I was 6.5 years old.<br>
        I Love tech, animals, nature and interested in spirituality.<br>
        I believe that we are souls in human bodies and there is a reincarnation. <br>
        My belief is based on Dr. Michael Newton, who was a highly acclaimed international spiritual regressionist that performed regression on over 7000 people,<br>
        All of them regardless of religion told him similar things.<br>
        You can read more about it at <a href="https://www.newtoninstitute.org/"> Michaels Newton Institute</a><br>
        Michael wasn't the only one who performed such regressions and all the other people who did this also came to the same conclusion.<br>
        So do not be afraid, life is not over with death<br>
